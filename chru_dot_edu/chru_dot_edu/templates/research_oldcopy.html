            The CHRU conducts epidemiologic, pharmacoepidemiologic, pharmacogenetic and health-services research addressing cardiovascular disease risk factors and outcomes in adults. We collaborate extensively with local institutions in the Pacific Northwest, such as the Group Health Research Institute, Seattle-King County Health Department's Emergency Medical Services (EMS), the Seattle Medic One Program, and the University of Washington Nutrition Obesity Research Center, to perform population and patient-oriented research to study causes and treatments for cardiovascular diseases such as myocardial infarction, stroke, sudden cardiac death, atrial fibrillation, pulmonary embolism, and heart failure.  The collaborations extend nationally and internationally, including the Cohorts for Health and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) Consortium and the US Food and Drug Administrationâ€™s Mini-Sentinel Initiative.

            <p>
            Funding of our research is primarily from public sources such as the <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/">National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</a> (NHLBI) and <a href="http://www.nia.nih.gov/">National Institute on Aging</a> (NIA) within the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health</a> and the US Food and Drug Administration. We are also recipients of funds from non-profit organizations and foundations such as the <a href="http://www.heart.org/">American Heart Association</a> (AHA), Locke Charitable Foundation, and the Medic One Foundation. Below is a list of current projects that are part of the CHRU portfolio.  Listed are project titles, principal investigators, and a brief description of the scope of the work.

                <h3>CABS-R</h3>
                <p>The Cardiac Arrest Blood Study Repository (CABS-R) is a large community-based repository of data and specimens from adult out-of-hospital cardiac arrest patients who were attended by paramedics in Seattle and King county, Washington. CABS-R is a unique resource for research on the determinants of cardiac arrest risk and resuscitation outcomes following cardiac arrest.</p>

                <h3>CHS</h3>
                <p><a href="https://chs-nhlbi.org/">The Cardiovascular Health Study</a> (CHS) is a population-based longitudinal study of cardiovascular disease among adults aged 65 years or older from 4 U.S. communities (Forsyth County, North Carolina; Sacramento County, CA; Washington Country, Maryland; Allegheny County, Pennsylvania).  Dr. David Siscovick and Dr. Bruce Psaty are principal investigators of the CHS, and have been actively involved in the CHS from its conception in 1989. The CHRU investigators and staff are actively involved in several on-going projects that use CHS data, including analyses related to diet, biomarkers, cardio-metabolic risk factors, and cardiovascular disease.

            <div id="CHARGE">
                <h3>CHARGE</h3>
            	<p><a href="http://web.chargeconsortium.com/">The Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology</a> (CHARGE) Consortium was formed to facilitate genome-wide association study meta-analyses and replication opportunities among multiple large and well-phenotyped longitudinal cohort studies. CHRU researchers contribute to CHARGE primarily through their affiliation with the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), which, along with the Age, Gene, Environment, Susceptibility Study -- Reykjavik, Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study, Framingham Heart Study, and Rotterdam Study, is among the consortium's founding cohorts. 
        		As part of the CHARGE consortium, CHS has contributed to large-scale genome-wide association meta analyses, targeted sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and whole genome sequencing efforts to better understand how human genetics contributes to heart disease and aging. CHRU faculty and staff participate actively in a variety of phenotype working groups and have developed and implemented guidelines and software for the efficient and appropriate analysis of genomic data. 

        		Bruce Psaty is the Principal Investigator for the CHARGE infrastructure grant, which supports semi-annual investigator meetings and provides training opportunities for junior investigators and postdocs, and for the CHARGE pharmacogenetics grant, which supports research of gene-drug interactions.

                <h3>HVH</h3>
                <p>The Heart and Vascular Health (HVH) Studies have been ongoing at Group Health for nearly 20 years.  This set of related studies allows investigators the opportunity to evaluate risk factors that affect the onset or course of a variety of cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, strokes, blood clots in the legs or lungs, and heart rhythm problems.  </p>

                <h3>MESA</h3>
                <p> The <a href="http://www.mesa-nhlbi.org/">Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis</a> (MESA) is a population-based study of the characteristics and progression of cardiovascular disease. MESA researchers study an ethnically diverse sample of 6,814 asymptomatic men and women aged 45-84. Thirty-eight percent of the recruited participants are white, 28 % African-American, 22 % Hispanic, and 12 % Asian, predominantly of Chinese descent, as well as 2,128 additional individuals from 594 families recruited through MESA Family by utilizing the existing MESA framework, yielding 3,026 sibling pairs divided between African Americans and Hispanic-Americans. Participants were recruited from six field centers across the United States: Wake Forest University, Columbia University, Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, Northwestern University and University of California - Los Angeles.</p>

                <a href=https://cleo.whi.org/SitePages/Home.aspx>The Women's Health Initiative (WHI)</a> is a long-term study funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and focused on strategies for preventing heart disease, breast and colorectal cancer, and osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women. These chronic diseases are the major causes of death, disability, and frailty in older women of all races and socioeconomic backgrounds. The WHI involves 161,808 women 50-79 years of age, and includes clinical trials of hormone therapy, dietary modification, and supplementation with vitamin D and calcium. It also includes an observational study examining the relationship of lifestyle, health, and risk factors with specific disease outcomes, and it includes Extension Studies in which additional health information is collected from consenting participants during long-term follow-up. Drs. Heckbert, Psaty, and Siscovick have participated in the WHI as Co-investigators; Dr. Heckbert is Principal Investigator of the current UW subcontract and is active in outcomes adjudication.</p>

                characterized studies, using genotyping, biomarker and gene expression measurements, we propose to investigate vitamin D related genetic variations and cardiometabolic risk. Study findings will address and/or generate testable hypothesis involving vitamin D related genetic risk
                factors of developmental origins of cardiometabolic risk while the mentoring framework will enhance preparations of an underrepresented minority to become an independent cardiovascular disease epidemiologist in academia with the skills and capabilities to address furher the developmental origins of adult cardiometabolic risk.</p> -->
